<h1>“J’arrive” System</h1>

With the Jarrive system the user makes his office into 'Smart Office', by controlling the Lighting and the air-conditioning through bluetooth technology.

The user installs on his smartphone the Jarrive application and connects the Jarrive system to the Lighting and the air-conditioning. Whenever he arrives to his office (get in the range of bluetooth) the Jarrive system opens the lights (by dimming effect) and after a while starts the air-conditioning. When the users decide to leave the opposite happens. The lights close (by dimming effect) and after a while the air-conditioning closes too.

The user has to just have his smartphone with the Jarrive application on him!
